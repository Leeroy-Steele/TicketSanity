## Remaining Items:

0. Add jira tasks 
1. Webhook Authentication (Password or restrict users that can hit endpoint?) - âœ…
2. Reduce Webhook payload (Take out contact details)
3. UI upgrade to allow selection of tech user
3. UI upgrade to allow entering password
3. UI upgrade to allow page refresh button
4. Allow saving on tasklist
5. Page refresh doesn't remove manualy entered data
6. Password can be cached in browser to local storage / cookies?
7. Can create new tickets from manual tasks
8. Jira 2 column shouldn't be hard coded to PAC tickets. Possibility for additional jira issues? 




## New ideas:
1. Status filter for `completed`
2. Add `my list` (Auto filter and sort)
3. Add show secondary boards?
4. Clear checkmark master button
5. Clear notes master button?
6. Option to mark as `worked on` or `resolved`. The latest 5 will appear in their own list, regardless of status, until overriden with a more rent ticket. Useful for remembering what I have worked on to raise in standup
